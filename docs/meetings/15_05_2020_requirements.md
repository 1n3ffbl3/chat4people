Search component (above contact list):

  - An application user can type any phrase in the search input. After X milliseconds, the contact list will display users whose firstnames or lastnames match the phrase. This can be improved in the future with more complex search criteria.

Contact list:

  - By default, the contact list displays all users of the application you are talking to. A conversation takes place, when you send at least one message to another user.
  - If a contact list search is active, it displays any user who matches the search term.
  - When you click on a user, a conversation with him should appear. 

Chat:

  - It displays a conversation with messages that have been sent between users. The conversation may have two or more users. In the alpha version, messages are visible in the chat box. In the next version, features such as deleting or editing messages will be added.

Message input:

  - It's an input where you can type a message that will be sent to the chat box when you press the send button. More features will be shipped in future releases, such as editing an already sent message.
